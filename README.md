### What I learned

Tindog was the first project that I used the bootstrap css framework to build a website. Using it facilitates the development in 100%.

I've comprehended how to use several components like buttons, cards and carousel.

Furthermore, I've comprehended how to built the website maintaining the responsivity in mind.
