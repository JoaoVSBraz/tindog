### What I learned

Tindog was the first project that I used the bootstrap css framework to build a website. Using it facilitates the development in 100%.

I've comprehended how to use several components like buttons, cards and carousel.

```html
<div class="card">
    <div class="card-header">
        <h3>Chihuahua</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <h2>Free</h2>
        <p>5 Matches Per Day</p>
        <p>10 Messages Per Day</p>
        <p>Unlimited App Usage</p>
        <div class="d-grid">
        <button class="btn btn-outline-primary" type="button">Sign Up</button>
    </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

Furthermore, I've comprehended how to built the website maintaining the responsivity in mind with media query.
